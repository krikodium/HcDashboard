The previous AI engineer successfully developed the Hermanas Caradonti Admin Tool from scratch, establishing a robust FastAPI and React full-stack application with MongoDB and JWT authentication. Key accomplishments include the comprehensive implementation of core financial modules: General Cash (dynamic categories, filters), Events Cash (provider management, client payments, expense reports), and Shop Cash (inventory management, CSV import). The engineer also integrated a live Twilio notification system and performed extensive code cleanup, resolving numerous ESLint warnings to achieve a clean build. The current focus shifted to addressing Vercel deployment issues, specifically configuring a monorepo setup and correcting backend import paths, which is ongoing as the last task.

<product_requirements>
The Hermanas Caradonti Admin Tool is a web-based administrative dashboard designed to replace manual Excel workflows for an events and d√©cor company. It features five core financial modules: General Cash, Events Cash, Shop Cash, Deco Movements, and Deco Cash-Count. The application requires daily entry tracking, approval workflows, multi-channel notifications (Twilio/Email), and data visualizations. UI/UX specifications include dark/light mode and a minimalist design. Security is handled via JWT-based RBAC.

The development trajectory shows an MVP with authentication and core modules for General Cash, Events Cash, and Shop Cash. Recent enhancements include dynamic project management for Deco Movements, global Cash-Count functionality across modules, dynamic Application categories for General Cash, and a dynamic provider management system for Shop Cash. Critical bug fixes addressed data saving, CORS, and hardcoded credentials. The current phase aims for final code corrections for Vercel monorepo deployment and ensuring all features are fully integrated and functional.

The project adheres to a standard full-stack architecture, separating  (FastAPI) and  (React) components within a monorepo structure, specifically configured for Vercel deployment via .



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Core backend logic. Extensive modifications for new API endpoints (dynamic projects/providers, General Cash categories, inventory), critical bug fixes (MongoDB date serialization, CORS), and integration of Twilio notifications across various modules (General Cash, Events Cash, Shop Cash, Deco Movements, approval). Latest changes include correcting local module imports for Vercel deployment.
-   : New model for product inventory, including stock management.
-   : New model for managing event-specific providers and categories.
-   : Updated to send live WhatsApp notifications via Twilio, using environment variables for credentials.
-   : Updated to use dynamic Application categories with autocomplete, and includes month/year filtering with chart updates.
-   : Refactored for dynamic provider selection in ledger entries, client payment marking with outstanding balance updates, and a new expense report view with filtering and charts.
-   : Re-architected with a tabbed interface, introducing an Inventory Management tab with full CRUD for products and bulk CSV import functionality.
-    & : Refactored to use dynamic projects and integrate with global cash count.
-   : Modified to fix authentication issues, including  warnings.
-   : Removed hardcoded credentials.
-   , : Emojis removed for a more professional aesthetic.
-    & : Enhanced dark mode color palette.
-   , , : Configured to prevent tracking sensitive files and provide examples.
-   : **NEW** file at the root level to configure Vercel for monorepo deployment, directing frontend builds and routing backend API calls.
-   : **NEW** file at the root, generated to include backend dependencies for Vercel.
-   : **NEW** file at the root, a basic package.json for Vercel's build process.

The project is currently configured for a single Vercel deployment (monorepo) handling both frontend and backend.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Critical Code Corrections for Deployment:**
    -   Complete fixing all outstanding Frontend ESLint warnings (, ) in React page components to achieve a clean build.
-   **Final Feature Implementation (Confirmation/Refinement):**
    -   Ensure general UI enhancements (emoji removal, dark mode) are fully integrated and meet aesthetic requirements.
    -   Confirm full functionality and integration of General Cash, Events Cash, Shop Cash, Deco, and Cash Count modules in the deployment context.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on the user's final and definitive set of instructions for concluding the Hermanas Caradonti Admin Tool. This involved ensuring the application is production-ready, especially for Vercel monorepo deployment.

Specifically, the work was divided into:
1.  **Architecture Confirmation**: The engineer has confirmed proceeding with the monorepo architecture for Vercel deployment and has created/updated  and  for this purpose (Chat Message 568).
2.  **Critical Code Corrections for Deployment**:
    *   **Backend Imports**: The engineer has started correcting local module imports in  to use relative paths (Chat Message 569, 570), which is crucial for resolving  during Vercel deployment. This task is likely completed or nearing completion.
    *   **Frontend ESLint Warnings**: The engineer has just declared the intention to begin reviewing and fixing all outstanding ESLint warnings in the React pages components ( files), specifically  and  (Chat Message 571). This is the immediate next sub-task within this larger correction phase.

The Final Feature Implementation (General UI, General Cash, Events Cash, Shop Cash, Deco & Arqueo Modules) mentioned in the user's last prompt represents features that were largely completed in previous phases; the current emphasis is on ensuring their seamless functionality post-code corrections and deployment readiness.
