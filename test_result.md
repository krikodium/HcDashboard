# Test Results - Hermanas Caradonti Admin Tool

## Testing Protocol

**CRITICAL TESTING GUIDELINES:**
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing is done, STOP to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly asks to test frontend
- NEVER invoke frontend testing without explicit user permission
- When making backend changes, ALWAYS use `deep_testing_backend_v2` to test
- After frontend code updates, MUST stop to ask whether to test frontend or not using `ask_human` tool
- NEVER fix something which has already been fixed by testing agents
- ALWAYS take MINIMUM number of steps when editing this file

## Current Development Status
