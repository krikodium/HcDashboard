        comment: "CORS configuration is working perfectly. All 11 CORS tests passed (100% success rate). Verified: OPTIONS preflight requests work correctly with proper headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, Access-Control-Allow-Credentials). Authentication works from different origins (localhost:3000, https://localhost:3000). All API endpoints return proper CORS headers. POST requests and error responses include CORS headers. The wildcard '*' origin setting allows access from any domain while maintaining security through authentication tokens."

    message: "Successfully completed comprehensive testing of Deco Movements module backend API endpoints. Fixed critical BSON encoding issue for date objects by adding convert_dates_for_mongo() function calls. All endpoints now working correctly with 100% test success rate (22/22 tests passed). Created realistic test data including 6 movements across 3 projects and 3 disbursement orders with different priorities and statuses. Data validation, authentication, filtering, and pagination all working as expected."
